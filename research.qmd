I am broadly interested in the decision aspects of Bayesian computational statistics and machine learning. In particular, my research focuses on developing **sequential Bayesian designs** -- such as active learning and Bayesian optimization -- for a wide range of application areas including *probabilistic numerics* and *ocean engineering*. I am also exploring what **post-Bayesian** ideas could offer for more robust, efficient decision-making.
