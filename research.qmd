My core research focuses on **physics-informed machine learning** and **decision-making under uncertainty**, often inspired from real-world applications in science and engineering. With physics-informed machine learning, I focus on Gaussian processes and investigate how one could inject physical knowledge into them while also computationally efficient. With decision-making under uncertainty, I focus mostly on sequential decision-making -- such as active learning and Bayesian optimization -- with practical constraints that requires non-trivial adjustments to the adaptive rules. The application domains I am interested in include probabilistic numerics, ocean engineering, and digital twins.
