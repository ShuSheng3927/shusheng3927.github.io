My core research focuses on **decision-making under uncertainty** -- such as active learning and Bayesian optimization -- where adaptive rules are designed to tackle real-world decision problems. I am especially interested in scenarios where we could leverage physical laws while accommodating practical limitations (e.g. restricted domains, computational budgets, unconventional data sources). These conditions shape the nature of decision-making, and often lead to developments of novel **physics-inspired machine learning** models and techniques. The applications I am interested in include probabilistic numerics, ocean engineering, and digital twins.
