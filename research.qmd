My core research revolves around **decision-making under uncertainty with physics-inspired machine learning**. More concretely, I am interested in how we can leverage probabilistic models with physical constraints (e.g., physics-informed Gaussian processes, probabilistic numerics) to devise decision rules (e.g., active learning, Bayesian optimisation), often under practical limitations such as restricted search domains, non-standard measurement devices, or computational budgets.

Currently, I am investigating spatio-temporal active learning for the deployment of oceanographic sensors. I am also actively exploring the decision-making aspects of probabilistic numerics.
