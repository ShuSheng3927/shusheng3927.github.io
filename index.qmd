I am currently a second year Computational Statistics and Machine Learning PhD student of [STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at Lancaster University and am supported by [TIDE](https://tide.edu.au) in Australia. I develop probabilistic machine learning methods for **decision-making under uncertainty**, with a focus on models that incorporate physical structure and practical constraints. My supervisors are [Henry Moss](https://henrymoss.github.io) and [David Leslie](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/david-leslie) at [Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/), as well as [Lachlan Astfalck](https://astfalckl.github.io) and [Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) at [UWA](https://www.uwa.edu.au/schools/physics-mathematics-computing/mathematics-and-stats). 

Previously, I did BSc Mathematics and Statistical Science at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths/) where I was mentored by [Sam Livingstone](https://samueljlivingstone.wixsite.com/webpage) and received a [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk) Award. 

I am broadly interested in computational statistics and machine learning methodologies, and their applications in science and engineering. See [here](./research.html) for more information.
